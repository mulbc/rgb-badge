# Software tools

Host-side utilities will include the deterministic content compiler, schema validation, release-manifest generation and analysis of power/runtime logs. Tools must be testable without a connected badge and must not rewrite measured evidence.

`check-led-libraries.py` audits the exact Coupon Rev A LED symbol pin maps, footprint pads, polarity geometry and the nominal 1.95 mm checkerboard-clearance calculation. `check-kicad.sh` runs that audit, loads and exports the project-local libraries through KiCad 10, and runs schematic ERC.
