# Coupon Rev A

Status: requirements only; schematic not started; not safe to fabricate

## Purpose

Validate the production electrical architecture and compare 1010 versus 1515 RGB LEDs before scaling to the 48 × 16 badge.

## Required contents

- 16 × 16 pixels at 1.95 mm pitch: eight columns per candidate package.
- ESP32-S3-WROOM-1U-N16R8 and external antenna.
- One TLC59581 and all sixteen level-shifted row stages.
- Production USB-C, ESD, Type-C detection and standalone charger circuits.
- Production 3.3 V/VLED converters, fuel gauge, battery-current monitor, NTC interfaces and controls.
- Native USB diagnostics and hidden factory programming/test pads.

## Release blockers

- Exact LED and battery-pack documentation.
- Completed calculations, schematic and ERC.
- Preliminary placement/routing and DRC/DFM.
- Independent engineer review with every finding resolved or explicitly accepted.

The intended first order is five PCBs with three assembled. That order is not authorized by this README.
